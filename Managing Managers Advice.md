[Managing Managers
Advice](https://korndaniel1.medium.com/managing-managers-words-of-wisdom-from-experienced-engineering-executives-9e8cdd9b5b78)

These are the lessons of veteran managers that have managed teams and managers.
It consists of wise advice from personal experience. All of them are sound, and
some of them apply to the general act of managing, while others are more
specific to certain situations. We want to take these advice and apply them to
our own circumstance and make it better.

# Side notes

Everyone is different, and there are more than one correct ways to accomplish a
task, including management. Don't force our management style on our direct
reports, as they all have their own unique ways of bringing out the best in
others. As I pointed out earlier, all advice will need to be taken along with
their circumstances and time frame, because those two factors can change
expected results dramatically. 

There's time and place for micro-management and macro-management, and everything
in between. Carefully judge the situation and see how much influence we need to
exert, and how much room we can give for others to grow.

Always be learning and reassessing our current situations. Something that is
once true and works for us, may become outdated and obsolete and hold us back.
