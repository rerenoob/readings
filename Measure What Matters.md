# OKRs

## Objectives and Key Results

Objectives should be ambitious, inspirational, directional, and aligned with
company's goals and objectives.

Key Results should be concrete, measurable, achievable, and quantifiable.

OKRs need to be formed bottom-up for it to work. OKRs can be set by different
levels of management in the company, organization, and individual. Everyone and
every team and every department can have OKRs and they should be shared publicly
for everyone else to see.
