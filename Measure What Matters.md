# OKRs

## Objectives and Key Results

Objectives should be ambitious, inspirational, directional, and aligned with
company's goals and objectives.

Key Results should be concrete, measurable, achievable, and quantifiable.

OKRs need to be formed bottom-up for it to work. OKRs can be set by different
levels of management in the company, organization, and individual. Everyone and
every team and every department can have OKRs and they should be shared publicly
for everyone else to see.

## Who Should Have OKRs?

Everyone, especially executive-level teams, should have public OKRs. This is to
ensure buy-in from everyone. The employees will look to their managers to see
how OKRs are set. 

## How long OKRS should be?

No longer than 3 months, aka quarterly. Longer than that and we will get
distracted.

## How many key results should an objective have?

From 3 to 5, and no more than 5. The point of have __key__ results is that so we
can have focus. If we focus on everything, we would then focus on nothing.
