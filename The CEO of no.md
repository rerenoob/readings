[The CEO of No](https://www.producthunt.com/stories/the-ceo-of-no)

We can have free time for things that matter, but we have to be intentional
about it. We schedule our priorities, and don't let our calendars filled up with
unimportant meetings.

I need to take control of my calendar and focus on things that are important to
me. I need to start saying no to things that don't line up with my priorities.
