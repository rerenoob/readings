# What is atomic habit?

We can create/remove a habit by first break it down to the smallest analyzable
units. From there we can improve each units to achieve overall improvement.

# Levels that changes can take place:

## Outcome

This is the behaviors/actions that we want to occur. This is the lowest level of
changes. If we focus on this level, there is a lot of mental energy that is
needed.

This is the "what".

## System

This is the way we go about achieving the outcome/actions. The system allows us
to produce the result in a predictable manner. Once we get a system in place,
little mental energy is needed to keep it running/producing the desirable
actions.

This is the "how".

## Identity

This is the person we see ourselves to be. Are we the type of person who runs,
(runner), works out (athlete), plays musical instruments (musician), or draws
(artist)? This is the highest level of change that we can achieve which will
cascade down and produces that system/outcome changes.

This is the "who".

# The four stages of habit

## Cue

This is what signals the habit. For good habits, make this obvious. For bad
habits, make this invisible.

## Craving

This is why we want to do it. For good habits, make this attractive. For bad
habits, make this unattractive.

## Response 

We perform the habit here. For good habits, make this easy. For bad habits, make
this difficult.

## Result

This is the satisfaction we have after performing the action. For good habits,
make this satisfying. For bad habits, make this unsatisfying.

# The four rules of habit changing

## Make it obvious (good habits) / invisible (bad habits)

The cue is usually visual, so if we can't see it, our craving won't be
trigger. There are ways to help with forming new habits. They are:

### Intention Implementation

To make sure we will start doing something, we can make it as explicit and
detailed as possible. For example, we can declare the time and place that we
will do something, like "at 3 PM I will workout at the gym". Similarly, we can
select an event as a trigger, as in "after I make my tea, I will meditate".

### Habit Stacking

This method is effective as we can "chain" your existing habits with new ones
to make them stick. For example, I brush my teeth everyday, so I can chain
another habit, such as wipe out the counter, right after. That way, one existing
habit can be the trigger of a new one.

### For habits, make it invisible

Most of our sensing information comes in as visual, so visual cues are powerful
that can trigger our craving without us evening knowing. To stop bad habits, we
need to determine their cues and make them invisible. Out of sight, out of mind.

### Environmental Architecture

One of the stickiest cues have to do with places and objects that associated
with the habits. For example, if we play video games and watch TV on the couch,
the couch will be the cue that is associated with playing video games and
watching TV. It will take a lot more mental energy to read on the couch.
Therefore, it's best to dedicate one activity per zone, so our mind can have an
easier time forming/maintaining the habit in that environment. 

## Make it attractive (good habits) / unattractive (bad habits)

### Temptation bundling

To start a new habit, we can bundle it with another attractive habits that we're
already doing. For example, we always brush our teeth anyways, so we could
bundle that with wiping off the counter or re-organizing the bottles/lotions. We
could bundle cleaning up the toilet with showering, as we might get dirty wiping
wiping the toilet anyways.

I personally use this technique to write more. Since I like to play League, and
sometimes I would mindlessly pay many games in a row. I bundle a habit of
"reviewing an article or a book chapter" with after each game. So now, whenever
I am done with a game (around 20-30'), I would spend the next 30' reviewing and
writing. This has been working well for me so far. Writing is actually fun, so
when I start typing, I usually can keep going without much motivation to do so.

## Make it easy (good habits) / difficult (bad habits)

### Environment Priming

We can make the habit easy by preparing out environment for the habit to occur.
For example, we can set up the room in a way that makes it easier for us to read
and difficult to watch TV. Also, whenever we're done with an activity, we can
reset the environment to make it easier for the activity to happen again in the
future. You would 'reset' the room.

### Commitment Device

Ulysses Pact (contract) is the story about a ship captain who wanted to hear the
sirens' songs, so he asked to be tied to the hull while the rest of the crew
had wax in their ears. That way, when the ship sailed by the sirens, Ulysses
could hear the songs without being able to steer the ship toward the rocks.

By limiting your future choices, you can make the habits very difficult/almost
impossible. The idea is to add as many steps in between us and the bad habit as
possible. For example, if we want to stop checking our phones for whatever
reasons, we can leave it in another room. If we want to not watch TV mindlessly,
we can unplug the TV, remove the batteries out of the remote, or put the TV away
in the closet after each use. If the obstacle is big enough, we will need extra
effort to perform the bad habits, which make them less likely to happen.

## Make it satisfying (good habits) / unsatisfying (bad habits)

### Habit Tracker

One way to make an action satisfying is to make progress visible. If we can see
the progress we're making, we feel better as the work is being paid off. A good
way to do this is to use some kind of habit trackers that show the streak of
habit/votes we've been casting. For example, I will mark the physical calendar
of the days that I work out. It will be visible for everyone in my family to see
so that it will be satisfying to keep the streak a life.

# Get Back on Track

The streak will end at some point, so we need a plan to get back on track when
life happens. A good rule of thumb is to never skip twice. It's fine to skip
once in a while, but we don't want to make it a habit of skipping, so never skip
twice. We need to let the compound do its magic, and bad days help us a lot more
than a skipped day.

# The flip-side of habits

Once we've gotten a habit down, it could be hard to change it. Once we've
changed our identity, we will do our best to defend it. It's important to watch
out for things that would derail our progress. There are a few things:

## The boredom we need to love

Once the habit is formed and progress is expected, the novelty will be worn off.
We will no longer feel the high or excitement from noticeable/visible progress.
Things will be normalized to the point where the habits will be seen as "boring
routines". We need to understand that the progress is still there and we will
want to keep at it. The boredom is a sign that we need to revisit and up our
games to attend additional results and get to the next levels. We can do this by
employing "deliberate practice".

## Deliberate practice and hyper-focus on the basics

Once the habit is formed, it's easy to keep it up. This is the point where we
want to revisit and focus on the details/basics that we can improve the habit
with. Some habits are fine once we're good enough at it, like brushing your
teeth. Look at the habits that we can improve marginally every day, or at least
work at it deliberately. For instance, if we make running a habit, just go on a
run may seem boring at times and not very motivating. We can hone in on a few
aspects of running that we can improve, such as speed, time, heart rate,
breathing, form, distance, .etc. Once we identify what we want to deliberately
practice on, we can continuously improve the habits.

## Pick a fluid/flexible identity

It's a good thing to pick and stick with an identity so that we can change our
habits with it. However, if we pick a rigid identity and then lose it because of
some unforeseen circumstances, we will feel lost and most likely derail our
progress. For example, if we pick our identity based on a role, say an athlete,
solder, or a chef, we will lose our motivation to keep up the habits if we no
longer hold the roles. As life changes, our roles will change. 

A good idea is identify ourselves with the attributes that come with the roles.
For example, for an athlete, the attributes are staying fit, drawn to physical
challenge, and being active physically. A solder's attributes would be
discipline, strong-minded, respectful. So when we pick our identities, we want
to identify as a person who has the attributes that we want. For example, my
identity is a person who is physically active, neat, disciplined, and
family-focused. I build my habits around these attributes as I will never lose
this identity.

"Life is flexible and supple, death is stiff and brittle. Be life, not death." -
Paraphrased from Lao Tzu.

# Side notes

To start and stay with a habit, we need to pick on that fits our predisposed
attributes. When the habits fit our natural attributes, they feel easy. When
they don't, life is hard. We want to pay attention to that and should not just
pick the habits that sound good.

For me, a few basic habits to maintain my quality of life to start, such as
staying physically and mentally healthy. This involves exercising and eating
healthy and reading and mediating. I don't particularly enjoy all of these
habits, but they are the basics and I will just get good enough to stick with
them. Other habits I can't spend more time deliberately practicing on, such as
BJJ, writing, cooking, and spending more quality times with family.

Habits define our lives, so let's pick some good ones.
