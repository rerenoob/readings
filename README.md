This repo contains my notes on things I've read. This includes books or blog posts.

# Personal Beliefs on Learning
I strongly believe we are all unique in how we learn. Something that clicks to a
person does not necessarily mean it would have the same effect on another. For
example, if you and I read the same book or blog post, we will have different
understandings of the contents. We will draw different conclusions and values
out of the same materials. Therefore, to get the most of out of any literary
readings __for ourselves__, we will need to read the original text, *not* the
summaries of others.

To quote Bruce Lee on this belief:

*"Absorb what is useful. Reject what is useless. Add what is essentially your
own"*

Anyhow, these writings are what *I* get from reading the materials. You may get
the same or completely different notes, and that would be totally fine. The life
journey of knowledge is fascinating with unexpected learnings you get from
random sources.

Keep an open mind and keep on reading, my friends!
