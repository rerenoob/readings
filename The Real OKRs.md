[The reasons why OKRs
suck](https://typeshare.co/michaelgoitein/posts/the-real-reason-your-okrs-suck-and-the-only-thing-you-need-to-set-them-properly)

If we focus on _Project Thinking_ in terms of how, when, and efficiency, we will
end up with OKRs that focus on the wrong things.

We have to think about the customers and the values we're bringing. Have the
customers in minds when we set objectives will allow us to pick ones that
actually matter.

For example, a good ORK can be like this for a security company:

### Objective

Increase customer's protection coverage with our offerings

### Key Results

- Increase the amount of breach data ingested by 20%.
- Introduce 2 new scanning functionalities to catch for vulnerabilities.
- Reduce the lag time by 10% for all APIs.
