[Hunting Tech Debt via Org
Chart](https://bellmar.medium.com/hunting-tech-debt-via-org-charts-92df0b253145)

Engineering org plays an important role in product development in any company.
The relationship it has with other organizations can likely introduce different
type of tech debts that can cripple the business when not tended to. The org
chart can be used to determine which type of tech debt it'd be, depending on
which org reports to which.

If engineering is on top, engineers will prioritize making systems overly
complex and hard to maintain.

If product is on top, the rush to ship features quickly can make the development
process slower by not tending to good engineering practices that don't yield
direct product values.

If security is on top, development of new features or upgrades will be blocked
which risks out-of-date software.

If the org is flat, open communication and internal politics will take over.

# Side notes

All organizations are necessary in the company, and everything should be in
moderation. They should be peers that report the CEO or the board.
