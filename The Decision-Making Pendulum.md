[The Decision-Making
Pendulum](https://candost.blog/the-decision-making-pendulum/)

# Decision making styles

There are four decision making styles that span from Authority, Advice, Consent,
and Consensus. It is best for leaders to learn and be flexible enough to move
between them.

## Authority

The leader can assume the entire decision-making responsibility and just
communicate out the decisions. No discussion is needed from the team. This can
end up dividing the team and sparked discussion.

### Advice

In this style, the leader guides/advocates for a decision. Even tho this is less
authoritative, it's still largely the leaders that decide the course of actions.

## Consent

This is where the voice of the many is heard and has the deciding factor of the
outcome. If nobody is against the decision, it is considered good enough.

## Consensus 

This is the most time-consuming way of decision making where everyone has a say.
The decision needs to be agreed upon by the majority of people who are affected.
Usually, when someone is strongly opposed to the decision, this needs to be
resolved before the final decisions are made.

# Lesson

The key is to know when to use which style. Leaders should not be stuck on 1
style of decision making process. Some examples I can think of:

1. Decide team culture: this should be consent, as it needs most people buy-in,
   especially senior folks.
2. Decide which project to work on: this needs to be authoritative, as
   priorities are often set by Product/Executive teams.
3. Decide how to do a project: this needs to be advice, as each company has
   existing infrastructure and practice that need to be followed, for efficiency
   and effective reasons.
4. Decide how the new interns their time: this can be consensus as everyone has
   a different idea on how to spend your time effectively on the time. This can
   also increase buy-in from everyone on how the team wants to juggle long/short
   term priorities.
