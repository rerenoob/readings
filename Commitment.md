# What about commitment?
With the world full of distractions, commitment seems to be in short supply.
Without commitment, we miss out on a lot of good things, benefits, and rewards
that only come with strong real commitments.

The author made a distinction between the optimist and the patriot. The optimist
loves a country because he/she thinks that it will be better. The patriot loves
her country because she thinks it is worth of loving. The optimist will abandon
the country in the hard-time, but the patriot tries harder in the face of it.

# Why commit?

If we want the benefits and rewards, we have to commit. It's worth it.

What does commitment look like? I think it's when you stop considering
options/alternatives, when it's "no other choice but this". To think about it,
the saying "it's good to have options" is only half true when we are considering
what to commit to, and it's the complete opposite of what we want when we have
committed to something.

# What can we do?

Let's increase our commitment tolerance. It's about mental focus and time
duration. If we can commit to something now for 2 hours, let's see if we can do
it for 2 days, then 2 weeks, then 2 years. The longer we can commit to
something, the more rewards we will rip from it.
