# The Cross Section Between Productivity and Meditation

In this book, Chris talked about meditation and his journey of discovering
productivity. He started out with a story of a monk in a cafe. It goes something
like this.

The author was sitting in a cafe studying and reading some books when a monk
came in and ordered a tea. The monk then proceeded to enjoy his tea in a slow
and calm manner, without doing anything else. This went against everything known
about productivity. Instead of reading books or socializing, the monk was doing
absolutely nothing except drinking his tea. Fast forward to now, Chris
identified himself more with the monk than with his former younger self. The
monk was doing something that would help boost his productivity and focus more
than staying busy and engaged could ever offered.

We can find out along with this journey.
