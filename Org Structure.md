# The three levers of shaping org behaviors

Whenever we want to initiate any kinda of org behavior changes, there are 3
modes of organizational controls you can manipulate to achieve the desired
results.

## Structure (contractual obligations)

Do what we are hired to do. This is implicit in most companies.

## Incentives (economic incentives)

We are paid for the work that we do.

## Culture

Influence of "This is the way we do things".
