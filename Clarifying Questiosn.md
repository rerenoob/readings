[Clarifying questions from Julie Zhuo's
tweet.](https://twitter.com/joulee/status/1457755662922829829)

For any statement, we can ask 2 clarifying questions to get more context that
will make the statement true or false. The questions are:
1. On what time frame?
2. Under what circumstance?

Once these two questions are answered, we will have more context to evaluate any
statement. For example, "rewrite this code so it will work better" sounds great
for long term growth, but terrible if we don't have product market fit.

These two questions will help us weed through advice we receive from seemingly
credible people. Many things will become true or false depending on the time
frame and circumstance, so let's make sure we get the context right first.
