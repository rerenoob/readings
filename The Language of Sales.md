![The Language of
Sales](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81QpEK5XzPL.jpg)

We sell everyday, to everyone, including ourselves, on things we want to do or
things we want others to do.

The most important things we want to remember is to ask questions. These
questions will need to be from your desired results working backwards. For
example: if we want to close a sale, which is the final goal, we want to know
what kind of people will want our products, then what kind of problems those
people have, then our product help solve those problems. These are the questions
you want to be able to ask and get answers from your perspective "client".
