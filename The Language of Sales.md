![The Language of
Sales](images/The\ language\ of\ sales.jpg)

We sell everyday, to everyone, including ourselves, on things we want to do or
things we want others to do.

The most important things we want to remember is to ask questions. These
questions will need to be from your desired results working backwards. For
example: if we want to close a sale, which is the final goal, we want to know
what kind of people will want our products, then what kind of problems those
people have, then our product help solve those problems. These are the questions
you want to be able to ask and get answers from your perspective "client".

## Tactics

Genuinely care about our client and ask questions to find out what they care
about, their needs, their pain. By doing this, we can establish common
ground/rapport that will help with furthering the conversation. It all comes
back to the following quote: "They don't care how much you know, until they know
how much you care."

## Side notes

After spending some time with this book, I realized I disliked the way the
author's style of writing. There is a lot of mixing of "general feel good"
writings, and it's very distracting. It may work for others, but it doesn't seem
to be a good fit for me. I may come back to this later, but it'll be a wrap for
me for now.
