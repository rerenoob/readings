[The Principles and habits of healthy
software](https://leaddev.com/building-better-software/principles-and-habits-healthy-software)

# Simplicity

Manage complexity intentionally. There are two types of complexity:
- Essential (comes with the domain)
- Accidental (affected by design decision, can be minimized)

Have a way to keep track of complexity (some proxy metrics. I am going to try
out https://github.com/pahen/madge).

Think about complexity from both at a low and high level. Low levels such as
function definition, conditional statements.

# Sustainability

Pay the technical debts along the way. Do it as a sprint or IDE refactors. Get
this integrated into the team culture. When you see it, do it, no need to ask
for permissions.

# Immediate Feedback Everywhere

Keep the test fast and accurate. This makes changes faster and increases
confident of the team to refactor code.

# Humans behind lines of code

Have empathy as a default. The code is written by humans, and we don't know what
we don't know. No feigning surprises when people say they don't know something.

Keep the knowledge distributed by:
- Pair/mod programming
- Design sessions
- Learning spaces
- Some good way to document decisions made along the way.
